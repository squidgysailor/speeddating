Note that this script assumes that the system has dictionary files of American male, female, and unisex names at `/usr/share/dict/american-male`, `/usr/share/dict/american-female`, and `/usr/share/dict/american-unisex`, respectively. If these files do not exist on your system, you may need to modify the script to use a different source for names.
